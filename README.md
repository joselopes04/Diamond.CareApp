## Aplication details
This was a school project it's not over the way I wanted it to be. <br>
I was thinking to better the way to save the appointments in the DB, because you can save many appointments to the same date and hour so the saloon it will be overcrowded. <br>
I wanted the user to be able to manage their appointments, I already add the swipe animation to delete the appointment, but its no linked with the DB. <br>
The points are useless, i was thinking about creating a version for the app to the employees on the saloon so they will scan 1 QR code that the user will have to add the points to the user and give discounts. <br> 
The aplication isnt totally finnished so expect some bugs. <br>
